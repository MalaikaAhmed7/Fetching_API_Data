Fetching API Data and Displaying in a ListView with a Search Filter

This Flutter project demonstrates how to fetch data from an external API and display it in a ListView with a search filter. The data is fetched from a mock API (jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) and displayed dynamically in the app. A search bar allows users to filter the data as they type.
